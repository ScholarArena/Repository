I need to formulate a summary of this approach for the meta-review. I will highlight the key components: the plug-and-play LoRA modules, the parameter-space composition, and the context-aware module. My summary should accurately capture the essence of their contribution for the record. I will also note the application areas they tested (multi-objective, continual learning, dynamics shift) to show the breadth of their claims.",

In contrast, we train each LoRA independently on a frozen base model. This is simpler, avoids conflicts, and is more data-efficient. We need to clearly articulate these differences.",

The modular design also allows easy management of the library (e.g., removing bad skills), which is an advantage over monolithic models. We will explain this trade-off.",
